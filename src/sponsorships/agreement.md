## Sponsorship
1. Sponsorship of an event can be done in different ways. To provide a venue, to provide food and/or beverages, to sponsor a speaker, to provide a donation, et cetera. For more information, see our [sponsorship packages page](/sponsorships/).

### Sponsorship at the event
1. During the event the sponsor is highlighted as a thank you.
    1. The sponsor can give a short introduction to the attendees of the event about their company/organization and available job openings. This introduction can be a couple slides, a short video or a verbal presentation.
    1. The sponsor may do this themselves, or ask the organizers to do this.
    1. We limit the sponsor highlight to five minutes.
1. Please answer any questions, both online as well as offline, from attendees. You are welcome to approach them and discuss your organization. It's recommended to join the [Netherlands Ruby Slack environment][slack] to answer any questions there.

### Sponsor contact person
1. One or more people from sponsors may attend the event.
1. One or more people from the venue sponsor should be present at the event as a point of contact.
1. The venue sponsor is responsible for closing and locking up the venue after the event.

### Sponsorship branding
1. The sponsor will be highlighted on the Meetup event page, available social media, the [Ruby Netherlands Slack][slack] and other appropriate channels.
1. The sponsor gives the organizers permission to use the sponsor's logos and brand trademarks to promote the event on printouts, social media, _Ruby NL_ event websites, Slack, and other relevant channels.
    1. Please provide the organizers with a media kit–when available–that contains logos that are legible on a light and dark background.
1. The location and size of the sponsor's logo may depend on the sponsorship package.

### Speakers from a sponsor
1. A sponsor can put forward a speaker with a talk. This talk is not automatically accepted. Let us know if you want to put forward a speaker and we'll discuss the possibilities.

## Event requirements
1. The organizers want to provide inclusive events that everyone from all ages, body sizes, disabilities, ethnicities, sex characteristics, gender identities and expressions, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationalities, personal appearance, races, religions, or sexual identities and orientation can attend.
1. If people can't attend, the organizers want to provide alternative ways for people to participate.

### Venue size
1. The organizers look for venues that are large enough for 35 to 100 people to attend the event. Provide enough seats for attendees during the presentations or workshops, and enough room to stand during breaks.
1. If there are limitations to the amount of people that can be present, indicate this beforehand. A limit on the number of RSVPs will be set.
1. Assign a space which attendees are able to access within the venue, and clearly identify boundaries.

### Health
1. Events generally take place in doors in offices with a lot of people grouped together for several hours. Consider providing adequate ventilation for the venue. Either with a ventilation system or opening several windows. This reduces chances of people contracting airborne diseases, like COVID-19. Buildup of carbon dioxide during the event will decreases people's cognitive function, causing people's attention to lapse.

### Accessibility
1. The venue, its entrances and exits are all accessible to anyone that has physical or other limitations. This includes, but is not limited to: people using wheelchairs, using crutches and people that are otherwise limited in their movement. In practice this means:
    1. The venue is on the ground floor, or;
    1. The venue is not on the ground floor, but the floor on which the venue is located can be accessed by elevator.
    1. To access the venue the attendee won't encounter staircases or smaller steps. It is unwanted for people to be carried to the venue to avoid such steps.
    1. There are bathroom facilities with an _accessible toilet_ with grab bars, or they are large enough for people using wheelchairs to access.
1. We'd also appreciate information on parking at the venue or available nearby parking for organizers and attendees traveling by car.

### Food and beverages
1. Food sponsors and beverages sponsors have several things to keep in mind:
    1. Beverages should include non-alcoholic options.
    1. Events taking place in the evening may include alcoholic options.
    1. Food should include vegan and vegetarian options. Meat and pescatarion options alone aren't acceptable.
    1. If possible, mention any allergens on food and beverages.

### Equipment
1. If an event has speakers, a large monitor or projector setup is required at the venue. Keep in mind that most presentations also include audio that needs to be addressed to the attendees.
1. Provide connectors if necessary, (such as HDMI and USB-C dongles) that are required for the speaker to connect their own laptop to a monitor or projector. The organizers will also bring HDMI and USB-C dongles.

#### Livestream
1. Most events will be livestreamed. The Amsterdam.rb meetups usually are livestreamed. Other events, like networking events, hackathons or workshops may not be livestreamed.
1. The livestream is broadcast and recorded on the [_Ruby NL_ YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rubynl).
1. The rights of the livestream and the recording belong to _Ruby NL_.
1. If a sponsor or other individual does not give permission to live stream or record part of the livestream that involves them, it will not be broadcast or recorded. By default, attendees aren't part of the stream, nor are their appearance shared in any other way.
1. The speakers retain the rights of their own talks.
    1. If a speaker does not give permission to live stream or record their talk, it will not be broadcast or recorded. For remote-heavy events, the presentation may not be accepted, and postponed to a different (in-person) event.

#### Livestream equipment
1. To facilitate livestreams, the organizers use their own equipment.
    1. To power this equipment a nearby power outlet or extension cord is required.
    1. It's preferred to use a wired ethernet connection for the livestream. If a wired connection is not available, it is possible to use a fast and stable WiFi network instead.
    1. It's required that the speed of the connection support livestreaming in 1080p at 30 frames per second.

### Privacy
1. People's right to privacy is respected. Attendees will not be photographed or recorded without prior approval. Their likeness will not be shared publicly on social media, blog posts, mailings, et cetera. without prior approval. Not sharing the likeness of attendees is the default.
    1. How to get approval from attendees and other participants? This can be done with an announcement before or at the start of the event, or before any recording (photograph/video/other) is made. A show of hands when asked for approval, or by use of other indicators (such as colored bracelets or lanyards) to indicate approval.
1. The organizers will not share any information with sponsors about attendees to be used for marketing or retargeting purposes. Attendees will not be contacted by sponsors with marketing or job offers outside the event without prior approval by the attendee.

### Code of Conduct
1. All events follow a Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct is based on the Contributor Covenant.
    - [Amsterdam.rb Code of Conduct page](https://www.amsrb.org/code-of-conduct/)
    - [Rails Girls NL Code of Conduct page](https://railsgirls.nl/code-of-conduct/)

1. A venue requiring identification by means of a legal document, such as a passport or identification card, is not accepted.

    1. It's possible for people to RSVP with a "plus-one". That additional person will not have to give their name to RSVP and will be allowed to enter with the person who RSVP-ed with a "plus-one", unless this contradicts the Code of Conduct not-allowed list.
1. The organizers hold the right to make exceptions to the above. In the past people were unable to RSVP through Meetup.com or a sign up form. They RSVPed by contacting us directly.

#### Non-Disclosure Agreement for entry
1. A venue requiring organizers and attendees to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), is not accepted.
1. If there is a risk that attendees can see, photograph, record, take home or otherwise access sensitive information, we ask you to put this away during the event. Make it so that attendees aren't able to access this information.

### Accountability

    1. for any costs or damages when an event is canceled or when an event is postponed.
